Arduino RGB Color Mixer â€“ Button, Potentiometer, NeoPixel & LCD

A small but powerful Arduino Uno project that lets you mix custom RGB colors in real time.
Use a button to select between Red, Green, or Blue channels, and a potentiometer to adjust the intensity of that channel.
An LCD shows your current channel and value, while a NeoPixel strip displays the resulting color.
